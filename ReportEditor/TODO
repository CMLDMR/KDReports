KD Reports editor
* Refactor how to handle previous paragraph (used to apply tabs and margin from the previous one if not defined on the current)
  - Current code is old and with other refactoring probably don't work well, and need to unit test that
* Allow to click on item like VSpace, Image in order to select it, not just a cursor.
* Allow user to add/remove column/row to a table (backend already exist, but need probably more unit test)
* Improve structure view in order to allow user to move item on it, delete item on it...
* Unit test text edition near a VSpace, before, after and solve problem
* Improve saving file (implement save, currently only save as)
* Unit test PageBreak and check its current code works (probably not after the last refactoring)
* Support model for image and text
* Support ifdef element
* Load header, footer and report in separated tree, and display the different view
* Allow user to launch a preview and set id and model for it.
* Unit test xml saving
* Display page break in the editor
* Modify property view for tab to allow user to add another tab or remove one (currently only allow to modify existing one)
* Improve color editor (don't display black color for invalid color and add reset button to go back to invalid color)
* Improve UI
* Improve editor shortcut (Ctrl Backspace, Delete Backaspace...)
* Some refactoring between ReportTextEdit / EditorData, some function can go to EditorData
* Keep the same object selected when modifying property
* Merge undo/redo for writing text
* Don't allow negative value for some property like vspace size...

KD Reports - xml
* Add watermark support in xml file
* Add columnCount for table header
* Add background and paragraph-background for image (useful if we have a text inline after an image / or a transparent image)
